Halo-01: This shows the previously mentioned halo effect that happens because of the halogen bulb and condensing lens. This effect can be quite useful to have when aligning your macro lens to have a perfectly flat plane relative to the slide. Adjust the lens and lens mount tube until the halo is in the middle of the frame and the camera is in focus.
